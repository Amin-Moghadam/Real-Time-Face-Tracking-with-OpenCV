# Real-Time-Face-Tracking-with-OpenCV
Built a real-time face tracking system using OpenCV and Haarcascade classifiers. The app detects facial and eye positions from webcam input and integrates screen/mouse control using PyAutoGUI. Great for gesture control interfaces and real-time feedback systems.
